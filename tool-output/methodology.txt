Solidity is flattened to single apps/contracts with
npm install truffle-flattener
(from truffle directory)
truffle-flattenr contracts/Whatever.sol > whatever.sol


$ myth --version
Mythril version v0.18.12

myth -x aragon-finance-flat.sol > aragon-finance-myth.txt


$ pip3 show slither-analyzer
Name: slither-analyzer
Version: 0.1.0
...

slither --disable-solc-warnings --exclude-informational aragon-finance-flat.sol 2>&1 | cat > aragon-finance-slither.txt

manticore --version
Manticore 0.2.1.1

manticore whatever.sol --contract Whatever --detect-all --workspace mcore_whatever

Turns out that for 20-25 contract targets like in Aragon, manticore takes a
while, so maybe I'll be uploading some additional results later.
